A cloud function is a piece of code that runs in response to an event, such as an HTTP request, a message from a messaging service, or a file upload. Cloud events are things that happen in your cloud environment. These might be things like changes to data in a database, files added to a storage system, or a new virtual machine instance being created.

Since cloud functions are event-driven, they only run when something happens. This makes them a good choice for tasks that need to be done quickly or that don't need to be running all the time.

For example, you can use a cloud function to:

* automatically generate thumbnails for images that are uploaded to Cloud Storage.
* send a notification to a user's phone when a new message is received in Cloud Pub/Sub.
* process data from a Cloud Firestore database and generate a report.
